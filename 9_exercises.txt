1. Write code that calculates the value of Pi using the Monte Carlo method.
2. Compare the computation time using loops and NumPy functions.
3. Compare how the computation time scales with the number of samples for both methods.
4. Write code that numerically computes the integral of the function 1/sin(x)*x^log(x) over the interval [1, 10].
