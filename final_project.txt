Build a text classification system using the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sunilthite/text-document-classification-dataset). Implement feature extraction methods including:
1.  Bag of Words, 
2. TF-IDF, 
3. n-grams (bigrams and trigrams), 
4. word embeddings (Word2Vec and Doc2Vec). 
Apply various machine learning algorithms: 
1. Logistic Regression, 
2. Random Forest, 
3. XGBoost, 
4. SVM, 
5. Naive Bayes, 
6. K-Nearest Neighbors, 
7. Multi-layer Perceptron, 
8. Large Language Models (LLaMA and Mistral). 
Measure training and inference time for each model in three versions: base (out-of-the-box), optimized, and parallelized (multi-CPU). Ensure reproducible results in all versions. Compare performance (total time) across versions. Final accuracy will not be evaluatedâ€”focus on performance and reproducibility. Include all code and a brief report.
Is it possible to develop a parallel pipeline that produces exactly the same results as the serial one (consider randomness in the methods)?
